# Private NaNoWriMo Server

This is a work-in-progress project to write a quick website where people participating in the NaNoWiMo challenge can compare their wordcounts and daily progress.

Since the new website does not show a graph of the current wordcount anymore, I thought to bring them back.

This is not going to be a beautiful website, but a functioning one.

I'm still learning Rust and this is my first web project with Rust in the backend, so don't expect too much.
